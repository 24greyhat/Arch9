# arch9 - fun and simple single address architecture (From the arch series)

## The bigger picture

<strong>It's stupid but it works!</strong>

if you're new to lowlevel concepts like virtual machines, assembly language; the arch series and lc3 are your best freind!

the goal is to build arch8 to arch5 growing in complexity and low-levelness (if that's a word)

arch5 is probably months from my "arch9 init commit" but when it's ready it's shoul be very much like armV7 with a touch of unorthodox features, that's the vission anyways.
